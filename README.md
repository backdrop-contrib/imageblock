# Image Block

This module provides a block type to add a simple text snippet with an image to any region in your layouts.
Image blocks are reusable.
Images can have an alignment set (left/right/center), an image style applied,
they can have a link or title...
Or you select the parallaxe effect to set the uploaded image as background for your block content.

There's an overview page for admins to delete unused blocks.
Using Image blocks you can create fancy landing pages or whatever your fantasy yields.

Please note: the migration path from D7 works fine for me, but might
need testing under different circumstances.
