# Image Block

This module provides a block type to add a simple text snippet with an image to any region in your layouts.
Image blocks are reusable.
Images can have an alignment set (left/right/center), an image style applied,
they can have a link or title...
Or you select the parallaxe effect to set the uploaded image as background for your block content.

There's an overview page for admins to delete unused blocks.
Using Image blocks you can create fancy landing pages or whatever your fantasy yields.

Please note: the migration path from D7 works fine for me, but might
need testing under different circumstances.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

## Usage

1. Navigate to the layout where you want the Image block.
2. Click to add a block and search for "Image block".
3. Add a file and configure the settings to meet your needs.
4. To reuse an existing Image block on another layout, search for the block. 
  This will create a separate instance of the block.
